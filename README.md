# The main problem

Nowadays, and especially the last days, many people and animals need help. Someone does not have home, work, earnings, family, sense of safety or access to medicine. That is why there are many orphanages, shelters, charitable organizations and so on. But how many people can actually remember about 2-3 such institutions in their hometown, and can help them? A few. Our solution to this problem was to help such organizations to spread the information about their needs. Moreover, we all have something that we may share with others like our kindness, time, food or clothes.
